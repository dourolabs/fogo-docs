# RPCs

The Fogo Foundation sponsors public RPC endpoints for both testnet and mainnet. These endpoints are available for developers and users to interact with the Fogo network.

## Foundation RPCs

| Network | RPC Endpoint |
|---------|--------------|
| Testnet | https://testnet.fogo.io |
| Mainnet | https://mainnet.fogo.io |

## Third-Party RPCs

For production applications requiring higher throughput, dedicated infrastructure, or advanced features like gRPC streaming, third-party RPC providers are available. See the [FluxRPC](/ecosystem/md_fluxrpc) page for more information on high-speed, production-ready RPC services.
