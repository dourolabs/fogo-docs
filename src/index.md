# What is <Fogo />

<Fogo /> is a Layer 1 blockchain built for DeFi applications. It is based on Solana's architecture and implements multi-local consensus to achieve minimal latency. The Fogo client is based on Firedancer and maintains full compatibility with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

- **On-chain order books**
- **Real-time auctions**
