# Getting Testnet Tokens

A public testnet token faucet is available at [https://testnet.solana.com/faucet](https://testnet.solana.com/faucet).

There are three options for requesting tokens:

- **FOGO (native)** sends native FOGO tokens to the specified address.

- **FOGO** sends FOGO SPL tokens to the associated token account of the specified address.

- **fUSD** sends fUSD SPL tokens to the associated tokne account of the specified address.

If you are using Fogo Sessions, you only need FOGO SPL tokens. If you are a developer, you probably want to get some native FOGO tokens to pay for transaction fees.
