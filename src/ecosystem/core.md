# Core

Metaplex Core is the most programmatic standard for NFTs powering the next generation of digital assets on Fogo. It's already been adopted by all major dApps and protocols for creating the next wave of NFTs. Metaplex Core offers all of the functionality of the previous Token Metadata standard and more, all while improving efficiency and cost by an order of magnitude.

## Key Features

Core supports the same features as Token Metadata such as Editions and Royalties enforcement, while also enabling new functionality through its novel Plugin system. The Plugin system creates a common interface that allows additional features to be added to an asset dynamically, even going so far as to allow third party integrations installed directly to NFTs. Popular plugins include Royalty, Attributes, Autograph, and more!

## Efficiency and Design

The Core protocol utilizes a single account design that allows it to achieve the smallest onchain footprint, reducing the overall rent cost to the smallest possible amount. This compact, single account also allows the protocol to abstract away many of the complexities of SVM by utilizing its advanced Plugin system, allowing users to have all of the flexibility of a custom protocol without having to develop a new program.
